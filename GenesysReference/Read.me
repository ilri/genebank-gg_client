The DLLs files GeneSys2.Client.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll facilitate the communication between the Genesys server and client applications written in Microsoft.Net.
These files provide the following capabilities:
 - OAuth2 authentication against the Genesys server
 - Access to the RESTful Genesys API
 - Exception  handling
